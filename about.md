JJ is a Sr. Partner Engineer at Chef, he was also the PTL for the Openstack-Chef
project, and helped bootstrap the OSOps project in OpenStack. He lives in
Austin, Texas and still is itching for Google Fiber.

He enjoys a good strong stout, hoppy IPA, and some Dwarf Fortress or Factorio.
He's a member of the Church of Emacs, and chooses Ubuntu over CentOS.

He's a father and husband, if he's not trying to automate his job away he's
trying to convince his daughters to "be button makers not button pushers."
