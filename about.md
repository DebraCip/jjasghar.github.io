JJ works with Strategic Technical Alliances at [Chef Software][chef] making integrations
work with Chef, Habitat, and InSpec. He works on everything from Azure, VMware,
OpenStack, and Cisco with everything in between. He also heads up the [Chef Partner
Cookbook Program][cpcp], dubbed Sippy Cup, to make sure customers of Chef and vendors
get the highest quality certified cookbooks.

He lives and grew up in Austin, Texas. He enjoys a good strong stout, hoppy IPA,
and some team building Artemis, madding Dwarf Fortress or Rimworld or possibly pair programming
cluster Factorio. He's a member of the Church of Emacs, though jumps into Vim on
remote machines. He usually chooses Ubuntu over CentOS, but secretly wants FreeBSD
everywhere. He's always trying to become a better Ruby developer, but flirts with
Go, Rust, and only when he has to, Node. A father and husband, if he's not trying
to automate his job away he's always to convince his daughters to "be button makers
not button pushers."
