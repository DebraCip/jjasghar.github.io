ChefConf's 2017 Hackday, I saw something. People came together wanting to hack on
Chef and Habitat, and it was glorious. I did notice something, that caused some frustration though,
a lot of people typed in the following to their URL bar:

![](../../../../../pics/chefdkio_chrome.png)

and nothing happened!

So I bought the domain [http://chefdk.io][main] to help out people who just want to download the `stable`
ChefDK.

I've also added these following vanity URLs to help too!

- [http://current.chefdk.io][current] goes to `https://downloads.chef.io/chefdk/current`
- [http://mac.chefdk.io][mac] goes to `https://downloads.chef.io/chefdk#mac_os_x`
- [http://win.chefdk.io][win] goes to `https://downloads.chef.io/chefdk#windows`
- [http://yolo.chefdk.io][current] goes to `https://downloads.chef.io/chefdk/current`

Hopefully this will help you in the future. :metal:
