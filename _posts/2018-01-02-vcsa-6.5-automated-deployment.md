You might be looking for a way to deploy the [vCSA][vcsa] without going through
the wizard. Or there's a chance you came across [this site][6-0-vcsa] and realized
that running `vcsa-deploy` is asking for version `2.3.0` and copy pasting isn't working.

First thing first, all the options for this JSON file is located [here][docs]. This page wasn't
obvious for me to find, and this maybe will help you too. No joke I ended up searching
`Cannot set key 'site-name' in section 'new.vcsa'` to find that page.

Well here's a deprecation warning that might start this whole issue off:

```
Execution Details:
=================== [1] Verify Template started at 18:46:48 ===================
Performing basic template verification...
Deprecation warning: You are using an old version of the JSON template. A new
template (version 2.3.0) will be generated for you. If you have already manually
updated your template, check that you have the '__version' field set to '2.3.0'
or higher.
```

Yep, that's annoying and you might have no idea what to do. Here as a template
of everything that was required for me to get a `small` (a basic) instance of
an Embedded Platform Services Controller and vCenter instance. Everything
here is a STRING, so if you see `<>` be sure it's surrounded
by `" "`. Everything in CAPITAL LETTERS are things you should change.

```json

    "new.vcsa": {
        "esxi": {
            "hostname": <HOSTNAME or IP>,

            "domain-name": "vsphere.local",

        }
    },
    "ceip": {
        "description": {
            "__comments": [
                [

                    "products. As part of CEIP, VMware collects technical ",
                    "information about your organization's use of VMware ",
                    "products and services on a regular basis in association ",
                    "with your organization's VMware license key(s). This ",
                    "information does not personally identify any individual. ",

                    "http://www.vmware.com/trustvmware/ceip.html . If you ",
                    "prefer not to participate in VMware's CEIP for this ",
                    "product, you should disable CEIP by setting ",
                    "'ceip.enabled': false. You may join or leave VMware's ",
                    "CEIP for this product at any time. Please confirm your ",
                    "acknowledgement by passing in the parameter ",
                    "--acknowledge-ceip in the command line.",
                    "++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"
                ]
            ]
        },
        "settings": {
            "ceip.enabled": true
        }
    }
}
```

This is the BARE minimum. After this, you need to run the first command:

```
.\vcsa-deploy.exe install --verify-only --acknowledge-ceip vcenter_config.json
```

This will make sure you have no errors or typos in the json.

And when you're ready to deploy:

```
.\vcsa-deploy.exe install --accept-eula --no-esx-ssl-verify --acknowledge-ceip vcenter_config.json
```

Yep, it's inconsistent, it's ESX on the command line and ESXi in the json. :facepalm: I don't have
certs on my ESXi hosts either, that's what the `--no-esx-ssl-verify` is for ;)
