Here are some direct steps to getting PowerCLI 10+ working on Ubuntu Linux.

First thing first, you need to get on a Ubuntu (debian) Machine. Now you need to
get Powershell installed:

```
~$ sudo apt-get install curl
~$ curl  https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc > MS.key
~$ sudo apt-key add MS.key
~$ curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/16.04/prod.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/microsoft.list
~$ sudo apt-get update
~$  sudo apt-get install -y powershell
```

Awesome! Ok, next you should verify that Powershell is working as expected.

```
~$ pwsh # <--- THIS IS HOW TO START POWERSHELL

SerializationVersion           1.1.0.1
WSManStackVersion              3.0
PS > exit
```

Notice the exit, you need to go back to your Ubuntu command prompt to to create a directory. You might
be able to do that in the PowerShell prompt, but due to the "non-production" release, it's best to
have this created outside of the shell then recreate it.

```
~$ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/powershell/Modules
```

Now go back into Powershell and run the following to install PowerCLI.

```
~$ pwsh

PS > Install-Module -Name VMware.PowerCLI  -Scope CurrentUser
Untrusted repository
You are installing the modules from an untrusted repository. If you trust this repository, change its InstallationPolicy
value by running the Set-PSRepository cmdlet. Are you sure you want to install the modules from 'PSGallery'?

```

Note: See the `-Scope CurrentUser`? That is required to make sure that the module gets installed in
the local directory we created in the above step.

You should be able to do the following now:

```
PS > Set-PowerCLIConfiguration -InvalidCertificateAction Ignore
Perform operation?
